###
Compares execution time for the same recursive algorithm for enumerating self avoiding walks implemented in a bunch of different programming languages (or compiler platforms).

Feel free to reuse and contribute, pull requests are very welcome!
This code is (and forever will be) a work in progress.

### Usage
Make sure make, Rust, gcc, clang, fortran90, Julia, python, gawk, php, nodejs, emscripten, elixir, lua and R are installed and just run:
```
make benchmark | sort -t: -k 2 -h
```
and you will see an ordered list of execution times (obviously less is faster).
