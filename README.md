###
Compares runtimes the same recursive algorithm for self avoiding random walks 

Feel free to reuse and contribute, pull requests are very welcome!
This code is (and forever will be) a work in progress.

### Usage
Make sure Rust, gcc, Julia, python and gawk are installed and just run:
```
make benchmark
```

### Todo
* Make as simple and equal as possible
